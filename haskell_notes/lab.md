# Lab 01

```hs
1 :: Num a => a
```

means that `1` has some type `a`, where `a` is an instance of the `Num` typeclass.
`Num` is not a type, but a typeclass, which describes common properties of various types.
The `Num` typeclass, for example, describes types that are numeric, and so support basic arithmetic.

```hs

all p xs = and [p x | x <- xs]

Note that there is a difference between `->` and `=>` . The first is used for the function signature; the second is used to show type classes.

```hs
Prelude> :t [[1,2],[3,4]]
[[1,2],[3,4]] :: Num a => [[a]]

[Polymorphic guesswork](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Type_basics_II)

```hs
Prelude> (-7) + 5.12
-1.88
```

This may seem to add two numbers of different types â€“ an integer and a non-integer. Let's see what the types of the numbers we entered actually are:

```hs
Prelude> :t (-7)
(-7) :: (Num a) => a
```

So, `(-7)` is neither `Int` nor `Integer`! Rather, it is a _polymorphic_ value, which can "morph" into any number type. Now, let's look at the other number:

```hs
Prelude> :t 5.12
5.12 :: (Fractional t) => t
```

`5.12` is also a polymorphic value, but one of the `Fractional` class, which is a subset of Num (every `Fractional` is a `Num`, but not every `Num` is a `Fractional`; for instance, `Int`s and `Integers` are not `Fractional`).

When a Haskell program evaluates `(-7) + 5.12`, it must settle for an actual matching type for the numbers. With no other restrictions, `5.12` will assume the default `Fractional` type of `Double`, so `(-7)` will become a `Double` as well. Addition then proceeds normally and returns a `Double`.

Integral

```hs
*Main> :t 4 `div` 3
4 `div` 3 :: Integral a => a
```

---
notice the difference, `zip` required two `[a]`

```hs
-- one
*Main> :t zip [True, True] [False, True]
zip [True, True] [False, True] :: [(Bool, Bool)]
-- two
*Main> :t zip [True, True]
zip [True, True] :: [b] -> [(Bool, b)]
```

```hs
[ x + 1 | x <- [2.0,-3.5,8.4] ] :: Fractional a => [a]
-- Reason: Fractional (and not Num) because we have floating point values
```

***Euclid's algorithm*** to find the greatest common factor

```hs
euclid :: Int -> Int -> Int
euclid x y
  | x == y     = x
  | x < y      = euclid x (y - x)
  | otherwise  = euclid (x - y) y
```

2.6  Explicit Recursion 2: Number replacement

```hs
-- my solution
intrep :: [Int] -> Int -> Int -> [Int]
intrep [] a b = []
intrep (x:xs) a b
  | x == a    = [b] ++ intrep xs a b
  | otherwise = [x] ++ intrep xs a b

-- answer
intrep :: [Int] -> Int -> Int -> [Int]
intrep [] _ _ = [] -- nice trick
intrep (x:xs) from to -- semantic naming
  | x == from   = to : intrep xs from to
  | otherwise   = x : intrep xs from to
```

isSeparator' c = c `elem` " \n\t,;:.?!"

breakTextHelper :: String -> String -> [String]
breakTextHelper [] acc  = [acc]
breakTextHelper (c:cs) acc
    | isSeparator' c    = acc : breakTextHelper cs "" -- or [acc] ++
    | otherwise         = breakTextHelper cs (acc ++ [c])

3.1 recursive addition

```hs

addition 0 0 = 0
addition 0 y = 1 + addition 0 (y-1)
addition x y = 1 + addition (x-1) y
```

3.2 recursive multiplication

```hs
mult :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
mult 0 _ = 0
mult x y = addition y (mult (x-1) y)

-- using foldr
multFold :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer

-- this one is easier to understand
multFold x y = foldr (\_ acc = addition y acc) 0 [1..x]

-- use (.)
multFold x y = foldr (addition . const y) 0 [1..x] -- addition definied 3.1

-- use replicate and from Integral
multFold x y = foldr addition 0 (replicate (fromIntegral x) y)
```

3.3 recursive exponential

```hs
power :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
power _ 0 = 1
power x y = mult x (power x (y-1))

-- using foldr
power x y = foldr (\_ acc = mult x acc) 1 [1..y]

-- using (.) and foldr
power x y = foldr (mult . const x) 1 [1..y]
```

```hs
-- power of 2
powerof2 :: Integer -> [Integer]
powerof2 n = [power 2 x <- [0..n]]

-- power of 2 using foldr
powerof2Fold n = foldr (\x acc -> power 2 x : acc) [] [0..n]

implement a higher order quicksort

```hs

  where
    smaller = [a | a <- xs, a <= x]
    larger = [b | b <- xs, b > x]

-- higher order quicksort
qsort' :: (a -> a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
qsort' _ [] = []
qsort p (x:xs) = qsort p smaller ++ [x] ++ qsort p larger
  where
    smaller = [a | a <- xs, p a x]
    larger = [b | b <- xs, not $ p a x] -- not (q a x)
